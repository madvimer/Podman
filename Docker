Limitations of Docker 

- A single process could be a single point of failure.
- This process owned all the child processes (the running containers).
- If a failure occurred, then there were orphaned processes.
- Building containers led to security vulnerabilities.
- All Docker operations had to be conducted by a user (or users) with the same full root authority.
